# About
This project is the fifth project for Udacity's Fullstack Web Development Nanodegree.  The goal of this project is to use a maps provider and the knockout framework to handle some of the functionality of the view.

The project is named Neighborhood Map.  It is a small application that hosts some data for a few pizzeria's in the center of London, UK.  It has a filter list that allows a user to filter the names of the pizzeria's.  When clicking on a list item, the map updates highlights the marker which has been chosen and an infowindow appears with some data about the pizzeria.  This app also calls the Foursquare API and gets information about how much the pizzeria is liked.


# Getting Started
To recreate my environment, you will a modern browser.  I used the most updated version of Google Chrome.  As my time of writing this, that is version 67.0.3396.99.

# Execution
All you need to do is the open the file `index.html` in your browser.  The page should render on opening the file.

If that is giving you trouble, alternatively, you can host your own server.  An easy way to do with is with python.  This is my python version as of the time of my writing this.  You will need the stardarn python library for this version of python (python2).
```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.12
```
Pull the project repo into a folder of your choice.  And navigate to this folder.  Once in the folder, execute the following
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You'll see a response in your terminal saying `"* Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...."`.  At this point you'll know your server is running, and can be accessed from a browser after hitting enter in the search bar filled with http://localhost:8000/.

I am not looking for contributors as of the time of me writing this.
